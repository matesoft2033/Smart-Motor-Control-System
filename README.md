# Smart-Motor-Control-System
The Hobby Gear Motor Control System utilizes an Arduino and an ultrasonic sensor to measure distance. The sensor emits sound waves, and based on the echo's return time, the system adjusts motor speedâ€”running faster when objects are far and stopping when they are too close, ensuring efficient operation.
